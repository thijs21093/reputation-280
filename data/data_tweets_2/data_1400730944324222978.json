This means that we put structurally similar chemicals together, with the assumption that they are likely to have a similar hazard and can be used in a similar way. The outcomes of the assessments for the first groups of chemicals are now available. By assessing substances in groups, the risk management of chemicals becomes more efficient, and making the assessments public brings more predictability for companies. It also helps them to avoid replacing a harmful chemical with another that could be equally harmful but has not yet made it to the authorities’ radar.We interview Chrystele Tissier, who works as a Regulatory Officer in ECHA’s Prioritisation Unit.
