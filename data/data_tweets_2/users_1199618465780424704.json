The EU needs the vision, engagement, and participation of all young people to build a better future that is greener, more inclusive, and digital. Data is at the heart of designing the necessary changes and EU should give incentives to younger generations to use EU data for more innovation in Europe, which is much needed for driving these changes. The EU Datathon is a key EU initiative aiming at creating new value for citizens through innovation and promoting the use of open data produced by the EU institutions.
