In the 18-35 age group, twice as many are likely to have a tattoo.The health risks of using dirty needles to inject the inks have been under scrutiny for a long time. Now, their chemical-related concerns have also been analysed and their risks have been regulated at the EU level.To protect European citizens, thousands of hazardous chemicals found in tattoo inks and permanent make-up are restricted in the EU under the REACH Regulation from January 2022.The restriction covers, for example, chemicals that cause cancer or genetic mutations and chemicals that are toxic to reproduction as well as skin sensitisers and irritants.In this episode, you will be hearing from a toxicologist, dermatologist, and tattoo artist who talk about the negative health effects of harmful chemicals used in inks and how restricting their use impacts the tattooing and permanent make-up industry.More**************Subscribe to our YouTub","unwound_url":"https://www.buzzsprout.com/1823152/9556295-making-tattoos-and-permanent-make-up-safer"},{"start":273,"end":296,"url":"https://t.co/8HDH0qMbXU","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/EU_ECHA/status/1466728587533459457/video/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/8HDH0qMbXU","images":{}}],"hashtags":[{"start":43,"end":53,"tag":"chemicals"},{"start":63,"end":74,"tag":"TattooInks"},{"start":79,"end":95,"tag":"PermanentMakeup"},{"start":225,"end":247,"tag":"SaferChemicalsPodcast"}],"mentions":{},"annotations":{}},"conversation_id":"1466728587533459457","referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":11,"reply_count":0,"like_count":9,"quote_count":0},"lang":"en","author_id":"84582815","source":"Hootsuite Inc.","attachments":{"media_keys":["7_1466692661327319041"]},"text":"Building partnerships within the #FoodSafety ecosystem and bridge research to policy is one of the aims of the #OneSociety session at #OneEU2022 conference. \nWant to join? üëâ21-24.06.2022 \n‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/Omn1G14Bcz\n\n@ECDC_EU; @EU_ECHA; @EUEnvironment; @EMA_News; @EU_ScienceHub https://t.co/Zpy1TNvbSa","created_at":"2021-12-03T09:00:09.000Z","id":"1466693728844853249","possibly_sensitive":false,"entities":{"urls":[{"start":191,"end":214,"url":"https://t.co/Omn1G14Bcz","expanded_url":"https://bit.ly/30XlBSL","display_url":"bit.ly/30XlBSL"},{"start":278,"end":301,"url":"https://t.co/Zpy1TNvbSa","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/EFSA_EU/status/1466693728844853249/video/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/Zpy1TNvbSa"}],"hashtags":[{"start":33,"end":44,"tag":"FoodSafety"},{"start":111,"end":122,"tag":"OneSociety"},{"start":134,"end":144,"tag":"OneEU2022"}],"mentions":[{"start":216,"end":224,"username":"ECDC_EU","id":"204752573"},{"start":226,"end":234,"username":"EU_ECHA","id":"331604970"},{"start":236,"end":250,"username":"EUEnvironment","id":"22362552"},{"start":252,"end":261,"username":"EMA_News","id":"116716199"},{"start":263,"end":277,"username":"EU_ScienceHub","id":"2754681001"}],"annotations":{}},"conversation_id":"1466693728844853249","referenced_tweets":{},"geo":{}},{"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":5,"reply_count":0,"like_count":8,"quote_count":2},"lang":"en","author_id":"84582815","source":"Twitter for Advertisers","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"text":"Thanks to all who contributed to our and @EU_ECHA parallel consultations on #glyphosate.
